%%% A page with automatically generated content of the bachelor thesis. For
%%% a mathematical thesis, it is permissible to have a list of tables and abbreviations,
%%% if any, at the beginning of the thesis instead of at its end.

\tableofcontents

% Introduction
%   Definitions
%     k-interval function
% 1-interval
%   Definitions
%     Spanning set
%     Disjoint spanning set
%   Zaks algorithm (without proof of optimality)
%     Prefix and suffix
%     General case
% 2-interval (?)
%    2-break - transform to 1-interval
%      break < step
%    3-break - difficult - show example from Dubovsky
% k-interval
%   2k-approximation algorithm
%     2k-approximates in disjoint case as well
%   Natural generalization of 2-approximation algorithm
%     for 2-interval functions doesn't perform much better
%     than 2k (?)
%     Relate to Dubovsky's 2-approx. alg. for 2-int. fns.
