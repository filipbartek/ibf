\chapter{\texorpdfstring{$2k$}{2k}-approximation algorithm
for minimizing \texorpdfstring{\acrshort{dnf}}{DNF} representation
of \texorpdfstring{$k$}{k}-interval Boolean functions}

\section{Introduction}
In this chapter,
an algorithm will be shown that computes
a small \acrshort{dnf} representation
of a Boolean function given as a set of $k$ intervals.
The input intervals are represented by pairs of endpoints
($n$-bit numbers).
An approximation ratio of $2k$ will be proved.

\section{Algorithm}

\subsection{Description}
\paragraph{Input}
Numbers $a_1, b_1, \ldots, a_k, b_k$
that satisfy the inequalities in definition \ref{def:kibf}

\paragraph{Output}
A set of ternary vectors

\paragraph{Procedure}
The algorithm goes through
all the intervals $\interval{a_i}{b_i}$.
For each $i$, the longest common prefix of $a_i$ and $b_i$
is computed. Let $j$ be its length.
Note that $\bit{a}{j+1} = 0$ and $\bit{b}{j+1} = 1$.
Now let $a'' = \bits{a_i}{j+2}{n}$
and $b'' = \bits{b_i}{j+2}{n}$.
Optimally span the suffix interval
$\interval{a''}{1^{n-j-1}}$
and the prefix interval
$\interval{0^{n-j-1}}{b''}$
using the (linear time) algorithm
introduced in \cite{Schieber2005154}.
Prepend $\bits{a_i}{1}{j+1}$
and $\bits{b_i}{1}{j+1}$
to the respective ternary vectors
and add them to the output spanning set.

% a_1 = 0
% b_k = 2^n - 1
% j = n
% j = n - 1

\subsection{Correctness}
\begin{theorem}
The algorithm spans exactly
$f^n_{\interval{a_1}{b_1}, \ldots, \interval{a_k}{b_k}}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
This is easy to see from the fact that the subintervals
form a partition of the multi-interval
(i.e.~the set of all true points)
% TODO: Use a better term if available
and that each of them is spanned exactly
by the suffix or prefix procedure.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Approximation ratio}
\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem:2kapproxratio}
Let $\mathcal{T}_{opt}$ be an optimal spanning set of
$f^n_{\interval{a_1}{b_1}, \ldots, \interval{a_k}{b_k}}$
and let $\mathcal{T}_{approx}$ be the spanning set returned
by the algorithm.
We claim that:
\begin{equation}
|\mathcal{T}_{approx}| \leq 2k |\mathcal{T}_{opt}|
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $\mathcal{T}_x$ be the largest ($n$-bit) spanning set
of a "suffix" or "prefix" subinterval
% TODO: Clarify: the interval is prefix or suffix
% on n - j - 1 bits, but not in general on n bits.
added in the algorithm.
Without loss of generality,
let the respective subinterval be "prefix"
$\interval{\bits{b_i}{1}{j+1}}{b_i}$.
From \cite[p.~36]{Dubovsky2012} we know that
there is an orthogonal set
of $\interval{\bits{b_i}{1}{j+1}}{b_i}$
of size $|\mathcal{T}_x|$,
and moreover that its orthogonality only depends
on the false point $b+1$.
Note, however, that $b+1$ is also a false point in
$f^n_{\interval{a_1}{b_1}, \ldots, \interval{a_k}{b_k}}$.
Thus we obtain an orthogonal set of size $|\mathcal{T}_x|$
for the $k$-interval function,
limiting the size of its optimal spanning set
$|\mathcal{T}_{opt}| \geq |\mathcal{T}_x|$.

Since $\mathcal{T}_x$ is the largest
of the $2k$ partial sets used to span the function
in the approximation algorithm,
we know that
$|\mathcal{T}_{approx}| \leq 2k |\mathcal{T}_x|$.

Joining the inequalities together we conclude:
$|\mathcal{T}_{approx}| \leq 2k |\mathcal{T}_x| \leq
2k |\mathcal{T}_{opt}|$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
The approximation ratio of $2k$ is tight.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
For every $k$ that is a power of $2$
we'll show a $k$-interval function such that
$|\mathcal{T}_{approx}| = 2k |\mathcal{T}_{opt}|$
(following the notation from
Theorem~\ref{theorem:2kapproxratio}.

Let $k = 2^{n_k}$.
Let $P$ be all the $n_k$-bit numbers,
that is $P = \booldom^{n_k}$.
Note that $|P| = k$.

For each $p \in P$,
we define the interval $\interval{a_p}{b_p}$
by appending $2$-bit suffixes to $p$:

\begin{itemize}
\item $a_p = p 0 0$
\item $b_p = p 0 1$
\end{itemize}

The first appended bit ($0$ for both $a_p$ and $b_p$)
ensures that there is at least one false point
between any pair of intervals defined this way.
The second appended bit ($0$ for $a_p$ and $1$ for $b_p$)
ensures that the interval has two points,
so the approximation algorithm will use two vectors
to span it.
Thus we have $k$ $(n_k + 2)$-bit intervals,
none of which intersect or touch.

Since $P = \booldom^{n_k}$,
we can span all the intervals by the single ternary vector
$\rep{\phi}{n_k} 0 \phi$.
Clearly $|\mathcal{T}_{opt}| = 1$.

However,
the approximation algorithm uses $2k$ vectors to span
the intervals,
since it spans each of the intervals separately
and uses two vectors for each interval.

We get
$|\mathcal{T}_{approx}| = 2k |\mathcal{T}_{opt}|$.

Note that the optimal spanning set is disjoint,
so the ratio is tight in disjoint case as well.
