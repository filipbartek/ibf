An $n$-ary Boolean function takes an $n$-tuple of Boolean values as input
and outputs a single Boolean value.
There are two Boolean values
-- we will represent them with the symbols $0$ and $1$
and we will call $\booldom$ the Boolean domain.

A Boolean function can be represented in various ways.
The basic representation is the table representation,
\todomaybe{Can it really be called the basic representation?}
which explicitly lists the output value for each possible input $n$-tuple.
For example,
the simple Boolean function $f^2_{\wedge}$ that realizes the binary logical operator of conjunction
can be represented by the following table:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cc|c}
$x_1$ & $x_2$ & $f^2_{\wedge}(x_1, x_2)$ \\
\hline
$0$ & $0$ & $0$ \\
$0$ & $1$ & $0$ \\
$1$ & $0$ & $0$ \\
$1$ & $1$ & $1$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The upper index of $f^2_{\wedge}$
signifies the arity of the function.
In this case it is $2$,
meaning it is a function of two Boolean variables,
or equivalently of pairs of Boolean values
or binary vectors of length $2$.
\todomaybe{Clarify \quot{binary vectors}.}

Other representations of Boolean functions
include
propositional formulas,
circuits,
decision diagrams

and sets of intervals.

In this thesis,
we will deal with the interval representation of Boolean functions
and relate it to propositional formula representation of a special form called \acrlong{dnf}.

Boolean functions defined by intervals were introduced
by \citet{Schieber2005154}.
A pair of $n$-bit numbers $a, b$
defines a $1$-interval function
$\intervalfn{f}{n}{a}{b}$:
$$
\apply{\intervalfn{f}{n}{a}{b}}{x} = 1
\iff a \leq x \leq b
$$

Note that such function is the indicator function
\todo{Is this term correct?}
of membership of $n$-bit numbers
in the interval $\interval{a}{b}$.

\citeauthor{Schieber2005154} showed an efficient method
to find a minimum \acrfull{dnf} representation
of any $1$-interval Boolean function
given by a pair of endpoints.\citep{Schieber2005154}

Since the problem of Boolean minimization is in general
$\Sigma_2^p$-complete \citep{Umans1998},
there is an interesting question of how difficult it is
to minimize \acrshort{dnf} representation of
a function defined by a set of intervals.
\citeauthor{Dubovsky2012} investigated the problem
in the case of $2$-interval functions.\citep{Dubovsky2012}

In this thesis we review the existing results regarding
minimization of \acrshort{dnf} representations of
single- and multi-interval functions,
and then present four new results:

\begin{itemize}
\item a simplified algorithm
for minimizing \acrshort{dnf} representations
of $2$-switch
$2$-interval functions (\cref{sec:2int2switch}),
\item
show that the technique used for proving the optimality
of the algorithms that minimize
\acrshort{dnf} representation
of $1$- and $2$-switch
(that is all $1$-interval
and $2$-switch $2$-interval)
functions
can not be used in general for
functions with $3$ or more switches
(\cref{sec:3switch}),
\item
introduce an algorithm
that,
given the intervals of a $k$-interval function,
finds the function's \acrshort{dnf} representation
that is at worst
$2k$ times larger
than an optimal \acrshort{dnf} representation
(\cref{chap:2kapprox}) and
\item
propose an improved approximation algorithm
for $k$-interval functions
and show that it does not perform significantly
better than $2k$-approximation for large $k$
(\cref{chap:betterapprox}).
\end{itemize}
