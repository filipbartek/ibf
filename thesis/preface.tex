\section{Definitions}

The basic terminology used in this thesis
was introduced by Schieber et al.\cite{Schieber2005154}
and Dubovsk√Ω.\cite{Dubovsky2012}

\begin{definition}[Binary vector]
For the purpose of this thesis,
we'll use the term \definiendum{binary vector}
to describe a vector over the Boolean domain.
That is, $x$ is a binary vector if and only if
$\exists n. x \in \booldom^n$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
[Symbol extraction]
Let $v$ be a vector of length $n$ and $1 \leq i \leq n$.
Then $\bit{v}{i}$ is the $i$-th component of $v$.

Let $1 \leq a \leq b \leq n$.
Then $\bits{v}{a}{b}$ is the subvector of $v$
that starts at $a$-th position
and ends at $b$-th position
($\bits{v}{a}{b} = (\bit{v}{a}, \ldots, \bit{v}{b})$).
\end{definition}

Notably,
$v = \bit{v}{1}, \ldots, \bit{v}{n} = \bits{v}{1}{n}$.

\begin{definition}
[Symbol repetition]
Let $x$ be a symbol (for example $0$ or $1$)
and $0 \leq n$.
Then $\rep{x}{n}$ is the vector of length $n$
whose every component is equal to $x$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Boolean function]
$f: \booldom^n \rightarrow \booldom$ is an $n$-ary
\definiendum{Boolean function}.
\end{definition}

Since we won't be dealing with any non-Boolean functions,
in the remainder of the text,
I will use the terms ,,function'' and ,,Boolean function''
interchangeably.

% http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_function
Every $n$-ary Boolean function $f$ can be expressed
as a propositional formula $\mathcal{F}$ in $n$ variables
$x_1, \ldots, x_n$.
There's a natural bijection
between binary vectors of length $n$
and valuations of $n$ variables
($1$-bits in the binary vector
correspond exactly to $1$-valued variables
in the valuation).

% TODO: Add example Boolean function with logical representation etc.

% http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunctive_normal_form
\begin{definition}[\Acrlong{dnf}]
A propositional logic formula $\mathcal{F}$
is in \definiendum{\acrfull{dnf}} if and only if
$\mathcal{F}$ is a disjunction of conjuncts,
where \definiendum{conjuncts} are conjunctions of literals.

We'll often view conjuncts as sets of literals
and \acrshort{dnf} formulas as sets of conjuncts.
\end{definition}

% http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_%28logic%29
A \acrshort{dnf} formula is
a \definiendum{\acrshort{dnf} representation}
of a Boolean function
if it expresses the same function,
that is
$\forall x \in \booldom^n: f(x) = 1 \iff
\valuation{\mathcal{F}}{x} = 1$.
% TODO: Rewrite; should be more natural or use the bijection explicitly.

To make our work easier,
we'll define a vector representation of a conjunct:

\begin{definition}
[Ternary vector]
A \definiendum{ternary vector}
is a vector over the set
$\{0, 1, \phi\}$.
\end{definition}

There's a natural bijection between ternary vectors
and conjuncts that don't mix polarities of variables\footnote{A conjunct
that mixes polarities of a variable,
for example $x_1 \overline{x_1}$,
is trivially false.
Note that leaving out such conjunct from a formula
always preserves the represented function.}.
Each of the $n$ components of a ternary vector $T$
corresponds to the single occurrence (or its absence)
of one of the $n$ variables of conjunct $C$:

% TODO: Correct equivalence sign.
\[
T \equiv C \iff \forall i \in \curly{1, \ldots, n}.
\left\{
  \begin{array}{lll}
    \bit{T}{i} = \phi & \text{iff} & C \cap \curly{x_i, \overline{x_i}} = \emptyset \\
    \bit{T}{i} = 1 & \text{iff} & C \cap \curly{x_i, \overline{x_i}} = \curly{x_i} \\
    \bit{T}{i} = 0 & \text{iff} & C \cap \curly{x_i, \overline{x_i}} = \curly{\overline{x_i}}
  \end{array}
\right.
\]

Namely,
a binary vector corresponds to a full conjunct,
and the ternary vector $\rep{\phi}{n}$
corresponds to the empty conjunct (tautology).
% TODO: Consider defining "more qualified", "most qualified", "least qualified".

It's easy to see that sets of ternary vectors of length $n$
correspond to \acrshort{dnf} \emph{formulas}
on $n$ variables.

\begin{definition}[Spanning]
A ternary vector $T$ of length $n$ \definiendum{spans}
a binary vector $x$ of length $n$
if and only if
$\forall i \in \curly{1, \ldots, n} .
\bit{T}{i} = \phi \text{ or } \bit{T}{i} = \bit{x}{i}$.
\end{definition}

If $\bit{T}{i}$ is a ,,fixed bit''
($\bit{T}{i} \in \curly{0, 1}$),
the spanned binary vector $x$
is forced to have the same value
in its $i$-th position,
that is $\bit{x}{i} = \bit{T}{i}$.
If $\bit{T}{i}$ is the ,,don't care symbol'' $\phi$,
the spanned binary vector
may have any value in its $i$-th position.

\begin{definition}
[Spanned set]
Let $T$ be a ternary vector of length $n$.
Set of points spanned by $T$,
denoted $span(T)$,
is defined in the following way:

\begin{equation*}
span(T) = \curly{
x \in \booldom^n |
T\text{ spans }x
}
\end{equation*}
\end{definition}

Note that every ternary vector $T$
spans $2^m$ binary vectors,
where $m$ is the number of $\phi$ positions in $T$.

We'll also use a natural extension
to sets of ternary vectors:

\begin{equation*}
span(\mathcal{T}) =
\bigcup_{T \in \mathcal{T}} span(T)
\end{equation*}

\begin{definition}
[$k$-interval Boolean function]
\label{def:kibf}
Let $a_1, b_1, \ldots, a_k, b_k$ be $n$-bit numbers
such that $0 \leq a_1$,
$a_1 \leq b_1$,
$b_1 \leq a_2 - 2$,
$\ldots$,
$b_k \leq 2^n - 1$.
Then $f^n_{\interval{a_1}{b_1}, \ldots, \interval{a_k}{b_k}}: \booldom{}^n \rightarrow \booldom{}$ is a function defined as follows:
\[f^n_{\interval{a_1}{b_1}, \ldots, \interval{a_k}{b_k}} (x) = \left\{
  \begin{array}{lr}
    1 & $if $ x \in \interval{a_i}{b_i}$ for some $i\\
    0 & $otherwise$
  \end{array}
\right.
\]
\end{definition}
Note that the adjacent intervals
are required to be separated by at least one false point.

% TODO: Finish.
